I actually got this idea Yesterday, But I didn't work on it. Basically I want a little 6502 powered conference badge with important info about me.
Such inclusions include:
- Name
- Email
- Website

As far as little interactive elements, I wanted some LEDS that go around the outside.
Kinda like

![Steelcon 2024 Kids Track Badge](Journal/Images/steelcon-badge.jpg)

But with 8 LEDs instead of 6 (for all 8 data lines obviously... Or is it 7? do you count from 0 to 7 or 1 to 8, hmmm)

I also wanted to make life significantly harder on myself, as I wanted to use OSHParks super freaking cool [After Dark](https://docs.oshpark.com/services/afterdark/) PCB stuff, which limits you to 2 copper layers.
And obviously the traces need to look good because like they are on display

Now, to decide on a layout for my information I opened up a figma and just started putting text down :)

All Icons are from [@hackclub/icons](https://icons.hackclub.com) because while limited in selection, I prefer them.

## First Attempt:

![Text V1](Journal/Images/text-v1.png)

While I enjoyed the simplicity of this approach, I decided to redesign because:
a) It doesn't really describe me and my personality
b) It would very easily get lost in the busyness of the camp.

## Second Attempt

![Text V2](Journal/Images/text-v2.png)

The main differences are:
- Centering
- Little invitational text
- A row of icons describing my hobbies and major features (rainbow = lgbtq, code = programming, image = photography)

I wanted a ring of icons, but I ran out of things that describe me ðŸ˜­, and I'm much happier with this anyway (it's not like anyone will look tbh)

Now that I know what the center looks like and a bit of my specs, I can start working on the Schematic.
This is optimised for looks and size over price.

I also realised that I need to provide a 5V voltage rail for my chips, To do this, I settled on a 9V battery and then voltage regulating it down to 5V. I'll leave the battery holder off the PCB since this is a pin badge of sorts

The specific parts I have gone for are:
- W65C02 (CPU)
- W65C22S6TPG (VIA)
- AT28C256 (EEPROM/ROM)
- AS6C62256 (RAM)
- Red LEDs
- 1Mhz Clock IC

I however need to size my Voltage regulator properly, to do this I found the datasheets for all my parts and started adding!

CPU: 1.5mA (I think?)
VIA: 0.5mA
ROM: 10mA
RAM: 15mA

So like, not too bad and a 150mA regulator should easily be able to do it.
Specifically I chose the [TPS7250QP](https://www.mouser.co.uk/ProductDetail/Texas-Instruments/TPS7250QP) because it's the closest equivalent that mouser had. Although I'm not a fan of the number of support components

The Typical Application Configuration is below:
![TPS7250QP](Journal/Images/TPS7250QP.png)

Meaning it needs 2 resistors and 2 capacitors.

I had to go footprint and symbol hunting for the TPS7250QP. I could have done it myself but then I'll be forever doubing my choice of footprint.

I now need to go hunting for 6502 symbols because Kicad doesn't already have one. But I will probably just make them myself as it's a standard DIP

Time to actually do the basic 6502 routing (connecting all the correct pins to power and ground and stuff)

Specifically this involves the following baseline connections for the CPU to work:
- VDD
- VSS
- RDY (Ready) - Needs to be High for the CPU to be enabled
- BE (Bus Enable) - Needs to be High for the CPU to output data on the bus
- SOB (Set Overflow) - Not recommened for new designs, so is held high as the datasheet suggests.
- RESB (Reset) - Should be held high, but pulled low to reset. This is done with a 1k resistor to 5V and a button to GND in my design

I also decided to redesign the Voltage Regulator as the messyness of the symbol was really annoying me :sob:)

And after a little bit of reorg, I got this! (Isn't this so much more readable :p)

![TPS7250QP Fixed](Journal/Images/TPS7250QP-fixed.png)

At this point, I decided just to make all my IC symbols myself. This made the process more challenging, but also meant that it would be consistent as I doubt KiCad has pre-baked symbols for these chips.

Like this one for the AT28C256 ROM chip:

![AT28C256](Journal/Images/AT28C256-symbol.png)

As part of the ROM element of the design I also needed a NAND gate to help with memory addressing. I chose the SN74HC00N for this due to it's low cost and high avaliability at Mouser.\
I elected not to make a custom symbol for this, as the Kicad one is sufficient.

The for-now completed ROM circuitry looks like:

I would also like to point out that I have downloaded any datasheets for chips used to the Datasheets directory in this repo.
